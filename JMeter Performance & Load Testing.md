# JMeter Performance & Load Testing
## How to Use JMeter for Performance & Load Testing

## JMeter Load Testing

**JMeter Load Testing** is a testing process done using a load testing tool named Apache JMeter which is open source desktop application based on Java. JMeter for load testing is a crucial tool that determines whether the web application under test can satisfy high load requirements or not. It also helps to analyse overall server under heavy load.

## JMeter Performance Testing

**JMeter Performance Testing** is Testing method performed using Apache JMeter to test the performance of a web application. JMeter for performance testing helps to test both static and dynamic resources, helps to discover concurrent users on website and provides variety of graphical analysis for performance testing. JMeter performance testing includes load test and stress test of web application.

Apache JMeter testing tool offers following **benefit** in **Performance Testing**

    - JMeter can be used to test the performance of both static resources such as JavaScript and HTML, as well as dynamic resources, such as JSP, Servlets, and AJAX.
    - JMeter can discover maximum number of concurrent users that your website can handle
    - JMeter provides a variety of graphical analyses of performance reports.


JMeter Performance Testing includes:

    - Load Testing: Modeling the expected usage by simulating multiple user access the Web services concurrently.
    - Stress Testing: Every web server has a maximum load capacity. When the load goes beyond the limit, the web server starts responding slowly and produce errors. The purpose of the Stress Testing is to find the maximum load the web server can handle.
